# ConstructiveSolidGeometry.jl

A lightweight constructive solid geometry and ray tracing package for scientific computing in Julia.

## Installation

Once the package has been accepeted by `METADATA`, you will be able to install via:

```julia
Pkg.add("ConstructiveSolidGeometry")
```

The package can then be loaded by:

```julia
using ConstructiveSolidGeometry
```

## Documentation

A full explanation of the package, its design and methodology is given in the examples directory:

[Introduction](https://github.com/jtramm/ConstructiveSolidGeometry.jl/blob/master/examples/1-Introduction.ipynb)

A number of examples are also provided in that directory:
