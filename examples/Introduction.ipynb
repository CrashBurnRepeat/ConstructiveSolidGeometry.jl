    "## 1 - Introduction\n",
    "### What is Constructive Solid Geometry?\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamental to many fields of computational science is the ability to represent the geometrical structure of an object in a manner that a computer can understand. One high accuracy method that is used in simulation codes is constructive solid geometry (CSG). In CSG, an object is represented exactly by definition of surfaces such as cylinders, spheres, and planes that can each be described by an equation. Complex objects can be made by defining spaces that form the intersection or the union of multiple different surfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Ray Tracing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Many computational methods also perform ray tracing, wherein a virtual ray (having an origin point and a direction) is followed through a CSG geometry to determine where its next intersection point is. In the context of my field of research, nuclear reactor simulation, CSG and ray tracing are used by both Characteristic and Monte Carlo methods. However, CSG and ray tracing are used by a variety of fields including Characteristic methods in astrophysics and computer generated imaging for animated media. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why a new package?\n",
    "\n",
    "In my field of nuclear engineering, development of most new simulation codes or prototyping a new simulation method often involves coding an entire CSG and ray tracing library from scratch. While there are a number of existing libraries for this (for example, in Julia there is the “Julia-pathtracer” package), they are generally graphics oriented and surprisingly do not provide certain types of functionality that a scientific simulation requires. They also are usually very heavy weight, with a lot of parameters to describe the many different types of surfaces and scattering that are required for graphics operations. For instance, graphics CSG and ray tracing packages place an emphasis on the features (color, albedo, texture, etc) of surfaces, but often assume that the spatial medium itself is of little interest. In nuclear simulation on the other hand, we care very little about the properties of the surfaces but care a great deal about the particular material the ray is passing through, which can be difficult to determine in many existing CSG and ray tracing packages. The net result is that existing packages are often either difficult to use for scientific simulations or simply not viable, resulting in many scientific programmers choosing to write their own CSG and ray tracing treatment from the ground up.\n",
    "\n",
    "While I hope that it may be useful for a wide variety of computational fields, I will only guarantee that it will have the features required for nuclear reactor simulations (Method of Characteristic and Monte Carlo) as that is my particular expertise and knowledge domain."

    "### CSG Halfspaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Any CSG surface can be said to divide all of 3D cartesian space into two halves -- a positive half and a negative half. These spaces are defined by whether the equation of the surface given a point in space is positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, take the equation for a **sphere**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$(x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2 + (z-z_0)^2 = R^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then move all the terms to one side and define a new function to determine the sign of the halfspace:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(x, y, z) = (x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2 + (z-z_0)^2 - R^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of a sphere, the negative half is \"inside\" the sphere and the positive half is outside of it. For other surfaces, such as an arbitrary 3D plane, we can follow the same logic and create a function to achieve the same goal. In the case of the plane, the halfspace is defined as -1 for points below the normal direction of the plane, and +1 with points above the normal direction of the plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this idea, we can then construct very complex geometry bounded by multiple different types of surfaces by defining \"cells\" that are a combination of surfaces and which halfspace the cell is on. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can repeat this process for an arbitrary 3D **Plane**, given its equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Ax + By + Cz = D$\n",
    "\n",
    "of in terms of a point $P$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$N \\cdot P = N \\cdot C$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "$N$ is the plane's normal\n",
    "$P$ is the point we are testing\n",
    "$C$ is a point on the plane\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(P) = N \\cdot P - N \\cdot C$\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally, we can find the halfspace of an **Arbitrary Infinite Cylinder** by taking its equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$[(P - O) \\times D]^2 = R^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P$ is the the point in question $\\{x, y, z\\}$\n",
    "$O$ is a point at the center of the cylinder\n",
    "$D$ is the direction of a cylinder (i.e., a point normal to an end cap for the cylinder)\n",
    "$R$ is the radius of the cylinder\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us a function for the halfspace of:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(P) = [(P - O) \\times D]^2 - R^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logical Cell\n",
    "\n",
    "A set of CSG halfspaces can be combined using logical operators to define a bounded volume of space. Operators supported in this package are the intersection operator ^, the union operator |, and the complement operator ~."
